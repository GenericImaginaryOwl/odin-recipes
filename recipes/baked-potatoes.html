        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked potatoes are a great main course dish that can be complimented by any sauce of your choice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes.</li>
            <li>Herbs: parsley, dill.</li>
            <li>Spices: Ground garlic, black pepper.</li>
            <li>Salt.</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and slice the potates.</li>
            <li>Put potatoes in a bowl, pour a little vegetable oil, add spices, herbs and salt to taste, and mix.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to about 170C.</li>
            <li>Put baking paper on a baking tray, and transfer all the potatoes onto it, and move the tray into an oven.</li>
            <li>Set the timer for 40 minutes and then raise the temperature up to 250C so the potatoes are crusty on a surface.</li>
